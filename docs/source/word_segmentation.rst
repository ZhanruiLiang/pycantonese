Word Segmentation
=================

.. versionadded:: 2.4.0

By convention, Cantonese is not written with word boundaries (like spaces in English).
However, in many natural language processing tasks, it is often necessary to
work with a segmented form of Cantonese data.
PyCantonese provides the function :func:`~pycantonese.segment` that takes an
unsegmented string in Cantonese characters and returns
the segmented version:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pycantonese as pc
    >>> pc.segment("廣東話容唔容易學？")  # "Is Cantonese easy to learn?"
    ['廣東話', '容', '唔容易', '學', '？']

Currently, the underlying word segmentation model is a simple longest string
matching algorithm, trained by
(i) the HKCanCor corpus data included in this library and
(ii) the rime-cantonese data (the 2020.09.09 release, CC BY 4.0 license).
The segmentation is constrained such that the resulting words
contain no more than five characters.

Customizing Segmentation
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

Because the current implementation of word segmentation depends entirely on
whether a potential word is found in the training data,
there are situations where you would like to explicitly allow or disallow
certain potential words to be treated as words by the model.
To this end, the :func:`~pycantonese.segment` function has the ``cls`` keyword argument
(think: the ``cls`` kwarg for ``json.load``)
that takes a :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter` object
for customizing in the following ways:

* To specify words to allow as words, pass an iterable of word strings to the
  ``allow`` keyword argument of :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter`::

    >>> import pycantonese as pc
    >>> from pycantonese.word_segmentation import Segmenter
    >>> segmenter = Segmenter(allow={"容唔容易"})
    >>> pc.segment("廣東話容唔容易學？", cls=segmenter)
    ['廣東話', '容唔容易', '學', '？']

* To specify words to disallow as words, pass an iterable of word strings to the
  ``disallow`` keyword argument of :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter`::

    >>> import pycantonese as pc
    >>> from pycantonese.word_segmentation import Segmenter
    >>> segmenter = Segmenter(disallow={"廣東話"})
    >>> pc.segment("廣東話容唔容易學？", cls=segmenter)
    ['廣東', '話', '容', '唔容易', '學', '？']  # 廣東 still exists as a word in the model, though 廣東話 is banned here.

* To control the maximum word length (default: 5), pass an integer to the
  ``max_word_length`` keyword argument of :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter`::

    >>> import pycantonese as pc
    >>> from pycantonese.word_segmentation import Segmenter
    >>> segmenter = Segmenter(max_word_length=2)
    >>> pc.segment("廣東話容唔容易學？", cls=segmenter)
    ["廣東", "話", "容", "唔", "容易", "學", "？"]

The keyword arguments ``allow``, ``disallow``, and ``max_word_length``
of the :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter` class
can be concurrently used in the same :class:`~pycantonese.word_segmentation.Segmenter`
instance.
